# celesteOS ArchISO Profile
ArchISO is a way to make Arch based live ISOs, that can be tweaked to your hearts desire. This, of course, is necessary to allow the user to install celesteOS onto their computer.

# Credits

- Keri: CI prep
- Dima: for helping this project start
- Venus: for being the project lead and doing most the work

Note: please build on tmpfs to avoid any problems
